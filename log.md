##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: August 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: 

- Test a few request to GitHub API to get info about repo, directory and file 
- Authenticate request with personal access token act like OAuth token to get more rate limit request

**Thoughts:** It's a bit frustrating when the first time read the documentation cause the API was so big, but after read slowly and search what I need, It becomes easier to understand the documentation.
